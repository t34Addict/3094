Ideas for how to get the project working:
- Make it so the user copies the input file into the program directory
- Have a function that takes the file as input? Something that scans the local directory? Or make sure the input files have a specific name (make them all "input"?) **NEED TO WORK OUT THE LOGISTICS**
- Have files that are for each of the test suites?
- Functions that are commonly called test combinations for each test. Each test has its own file **FOCUS ON MODULAR FUNCTIONS**
- Then, have a "main.py", to tie everything all together and act as a main menu.

## Ideal Runtime Scenatrio:
- User has input file in the directory
- Runs the program.
- Selects the test on the input
- Test is called
- Output of the tests are displayed in a markdown file.


## Logistics
I am not sure about the logistics
